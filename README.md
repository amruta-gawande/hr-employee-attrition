This project was built as a part of INSAID Capstone Project to help HR Advisories to help detect possible employees who may end up quitting the organization. 
The data was source from the HRMS where the details of all past and current employees were being recorded for the last 15 years.

In this project, the outcome is a classification where we judge whether the employee is going to quit or no.
